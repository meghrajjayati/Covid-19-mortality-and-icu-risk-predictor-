# Covid-19-mortality-and-icu-risk-predictor-
To predict the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the next 2 weeks from a given date. 

Healthcare systems are often overwhelmed during surges in Covid-19 infections, resulting in in- sufficient intensive care ammenities. Many patients suffering from life-threatening symptoms are not able to get access to lifesaving medical equipment, leaving doctors hard-pressed to choose which patients should get access to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Our goal for this project is to study the parameters which contribute to the development of severe symptoms and build a model to predict which patients entering triage will likely require ICU treatment. This would allow hospitals to better plan manpower and amenity allocations in the short-term and allow healthcare workers to pay closer attention to patients who may have a high risk of developing severe symptoms, hopefully preventing mishaps in planning and reducing the number of deaths.
